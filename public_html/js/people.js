Dr. Schaffer's lab has recently shown that NSCs are sensitive to mechanical stimuli from the extracellular matrix (ECM) during a short temporal window (12-36hs) that determines their fate days or even weeks later. My aim is to use optogenetic tools engineered at our lab to unravel the mechanisms responsible for this mechanical memory. In particular, my research is focused in the study of the role of small GTPases of the Rho subfamily, RhoA and Cdc42, which have been described to participate in mechanotransduction in NSC. Future applications of this knowledge include new therapies such as functionalized biomaterials with the potential to replace damaged brain tissues or interventions to target RhoA/Cdc42 pathways to control NSC differentiation.","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"David Schaffer","Nickname":"","Img Type":"jpg"},

Similarly, by introducing diverse genetic libraries into environments designed to favor the propagation of desired functionalities, we can emulate natural evolution to engineer useful new biotechnology. This technique is known as directed evolution and classically requires the iterative repetition of two separate steps: (i) constructing a diverse library of DNA coding sequences by random mutagenesis, and (ii) delivering those coding sequences into suitable living hosts for expression and screening for desired functionality.To minimize the frequency of false “winner” mutants whose success through screening does not ultimately translate to its intended use case, directed evolution screening pipelines must accurately recapitulate the environment in which variants are ultimately expected to function. Some therapeutic modalities, like immune cell therapies (e.g. CAR-T), may be improved by screening libraries of proteins directly within a human cell for their ability to initiate specific signalling cascades. Nevertheless, current directed evolution pipelines are unsuited for the repeated diversification and screening of genomically-integrated libraries in human cells. To address this need, I aim to adapt CRISPR-guided error-prone DNA polymerases (EvolvR) for the continuous, targeted diversification of transgenes in mammalian cells. By continuously generating diversity directly within the genome, EvolvR may eliminate screening bottlenecks related to inefficiencies in library delivery while enabling long-term diversification and interrogation of libraries for the discovery of rare and highly-optimized fitness peaks.","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"David Schaffer, John Dueber","Nickname":"","Img Type":"jpg"},

Of particular interest are midbrain dopaminergic neurons because degeneration or loss of function of these neurons is associated with Parkinson's disease. Many protocols used to direct hESCs to develop into dopaminergic neurons are highly inefficient, or use co-culture systems of hESCs with cells of animal origin which prevents any downstream clinical application due to possible transfer of animal cells and pathogens. Also, most of these strategies employ classical two-dimensional culturing conditions for neuronal and dopaminergic induction which have limited relevance to the native three-dimensional conditions. Other major challenges that must be overcome to realize the therapeutic potential of hESC-derived dopaminergic neurons are poor survival and integration upon transplantation. To overcome these obstacles, we aim to design defined three-dimensional biological systems functionalized with bioactive components including recently identified midbrain patterning molecules and neurotrophic factors to support efficient dopaminergic differentiation of hESCs ex vivo. These cellular scaffolds are also designed to act as a temporary extracellular matrix after transplantation to enhance the survival and functional integration in vivo to meet the requirements for cell-based strategies for brain repair.","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"","Nickname":"","Img Type":"jpg"},
