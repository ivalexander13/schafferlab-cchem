The complexity of these networks is compounded by their dynamic nature in both space and time. Unfortunately, current technologies are insufficient to interrogate and reproduce protein signals with the spatiotemporal resolution at which they occur in nature, thus limiting our ability to understand them. We aim to engineer novel protein systems to enable photoactivation of various signaling proteins. Successful development of such light-inducible tools will provide unprecedented fine control over protein signal duration, intensity and location within living cells and tissues. Varying these parameters and observing the corresponding biological outputs will help illuminate how signalling dynamics determine cell fate. Identifying these input-output relationships is of great interest to the field of stem cell engineering, where properly manipulating cellular environments and signals will allow the efficient generation of therapeutically relevant target cell types.","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"","Nickname":"","Img Type":"jpg"},{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Ekerdt","Occupation":"Graduate Student","Department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","Former Education":"BS in Chemical Engineering at University of Texas at Austin","Project title":"Nanopatterned chemistry and topography using block copolymers and photolithography for stem cell differentiation","Project description":"My project focuses on determining how a surface's topography can effect neural stem cell differentiation.

Several characteristics make them desirable, such as their ability to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells and to elicit a long-term expression of the delivered gene via its integration into the host cell's genome. However, this insertion, which in lentiviruses occurs in a semi-random way, poses a risk of insertional mutagenesis, which could represent a health hazard when utilizing the lentiviruses in gene therapy. One way to circumvent this feature and to improve the vector's safety is to direct the integration events such that they are targeted to a specific site within the host cell's genome that would be safe for integration. This project aims to engineer a lentiviral vector with directed integration properties. The approach taken involves the insertion of DNA binding domains, which specifically target DNA sequences suitable for insertions, in permissible sites within the viral proteins.","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"","Nickname":"","Img Type":"jpg"},{"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":"Scheideler","Occupation":"Graduate Student","Department":"Bioengineering","Former Education":"BS University of Nebraska-Lincoln","Project title":"Engineering Strategies for Dissecting the Neural Stem Cell Niche","Project description":"","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"","Nickname":"","Img Type":"jpg"},{"firstName":"Dawn","lastName":"Spelke","Occupation":"Graduate Student","Department":"Bioengineering","Former Education":"MIT, BS (2009)","Project title":"Molecular mechanisms of cell-cell signaling in neural stem cells","Project description":"I am interested in studying and controlling the molecular mechanisms of cell-cell signaling in neural stem cells (NSCs).

Of particular interest are midbrain dopaminergic neurons because degeneration or loss of function of these neurons is associated with Parkinson's disease. Many protocols used to direct hESCs to develop into dopaminergic neurons are highly inefficient, or use co-culture systems of hESCs with cells of animal origin which prevents any downstream clinical application due to possible transfer of animal cells and pathogens. Also, most of these strategies employ classical two-dimensional culturing conditions for neuronal and dopaminergic induction which have limited relevance to the native three-dimensional conditions. Other major challenges that must be overcome to realize the therapeutic potential of hESC-derived dopaminergic neurons are poor survival and integration upon transplantation. To overcome these obstacles, we aim to design defined three-dimensional biological systems functionalized with bioactive components including recently identified midbrain patterning molecules and neurotrophic factors to support efficient dopaminergic differentiation of hESCs ex vivo. These cellular scaffolds are also designed to act as a temporary extracellular matrix after transplantation to enhance the survival and functional integration in vivo to meet the requirements for cell-based strategies for brain repair.","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"","Nickname":"","Img
